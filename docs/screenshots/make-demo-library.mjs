Your notes, tasks, and bookmarks — **plain files, fully local**.

## Why Deckle?

- Live WYSIWYG Markdown editing
- An AI assistant that can *search and edit* your library
- A Todoist-style planner with due dates and a calendar
- Bookmarks with collections and comments

> Everything is stored as plain Markdown in a folder you choose — open it in any editor, sync it, or back it up however you like.

Press \`Ctrl/Cmd + K\` to open the command palette.

  'Projects/Product launch plan.md': `# Product launch plan

Shipping the pricing page, the changelog and the announcement in the same week.

## Open questions

- Do we gate the API behind the paid tier at launch, or after?
- Who owns the status page if something breaks on the day?

## Sequence

1. Freeze the pricing copy
2. Rebuild the changelog from the release notes
3. Announcement goes out once the page is live, not before
`,

  'Projects/Website redesign.md': `# Website redesign

The old site was three landing pages wearing a trench coat. One grid, one type scale, one accent.

- Type scale settled at 1.2, which survives translation better than 1.25
- Hairline rules instead of cards — the content is the structure
- Dark mode is not a filter over the light palette; the greys are re-picked
`,

  'Reading/Atomic Habits.md': `# Atomic Habits

The argument that stuck: you do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.

- Make it obvious, attractive, easy, satisfying
- Habit stacking: attach the new thing to a thing you already do without thinking
- Environment beats willpower, reliably

Worth pairing with the argument for keeping notes as plain files — see [[Welcome]].
`,

  'Ideas.md': `# Ideas

- A reading queue that admits when you are never going to read something
- Plain-text budget, one file per month, no app
- Keyboard-only photo triage
- A changelog that writes itself from commit messages, badly, then gets edited
`,

  'Meeting notes.md': `# Meeting notes

## Launch review

Pricing page is the blocker. Copy is 80% there; the comparison table is the part nobody agrees on.

**Decided:** ship without the comparison table, add it the week after.

## Beta feedback themes

- Folder drag-and-drop was discovered without prompting
- Two people asked where the notes actually live — the answer needs to be on the first screen, not in the docs
- Nobody used the split editor until they saw it in the palette
