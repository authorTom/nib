// Executing one queued run, one step at a time.
//
// This is not `useAssistant.runLoop` with different arguments, and the
// difference is worth stating because the two look alike. The chat panel
// pauses for approval by awaiting a promise the UI resolves — the loop is
// still on the stack, the user is still there, the browser has not moved. A
// queued run has to stop for a person who may not come back today: the loop
// must *return*, everything needed to continue must be on disk, and picking it
// back up may happen after a reload, in a different tab, or eventually in a
// server-side worker that never had the promise.
//
// So this is a step machine. `advance` runs until the work is done or until it
// owes somebody an answer, and says which. Resuming is calling it again.
