// The assistant's settings, kept for the whole server rather than per browser.
//
// Deckle's settings normally live in localStorage, which is the right home for
// them: they describe how *this browser* talks to a provider. The server
// library breaks that assumption — it exists so the same library is reachable
// from any device, and asking for the API key again on every one of them is a
// poor answer to "your notes are wherever you are".
//
// So a server library keeps one copy of them here, and every device that signs
// in reads it. Two properties matter, both of them about the key:
//
//   * It lives *outside* the library. The notes folder travels — exports,
//     backups, the machine API, the assistant's own read_note tool — and a
//     provider key must not travel with it. See RESERVED_DIR in
//     library-api.mjs, which is what keeps this folder invisible to all of
//     that.
//   * It is only served to a request that has already passed the password
//     gate. With no DECKLE_PASSWORD the API is open by design, and the caller
//     refuses to store keys at all in that case.
//
// It is stored in plain text, readable by this process and by whoever can read
// the volume. Encrypting it would only move the problem — the server would
// still have to hand the key to the browser, which is what actually calls the
// provider.
